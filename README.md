Collection of in-progress libraries for entity neural networks: [Neural Network Architectures for Structured State](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q87zeY7Z4u9cU0oLoH-BPQZDBQd4tHLWiEkj5YDSGw4)

- [Entity Gym](entity_gym): Abstraction over reinforcement learning environments that represent observations as lists of structured objects.
- [ENN-PPO](enn_ppo): PPO training loop for entity-gym environments.
- [RogueNet](rogue_net): Ragged batch transformer implementation that accepts variable length lists of structured objects as inputs.
- [ENN-Zoo](enn_bench): Collection of entity gym bindings for different environments.
- [ENN-BC](enn_bc): Supervised training loop on behavioral cloning datasets collected from entity-gym policies.
