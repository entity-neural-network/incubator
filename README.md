The enn-incubator repo was used to develop a number of different projects which have since been split out into their own repos:

- [entity-gym](https://github.com/entity-neural-network/entity-gym): Abstraction over reinforcement learning environments that represent observations as lists of structured objects.
- [enn-trainer](https://github.com/entity-neural-network/enn-trainer): PPO training loop for entity-gym environments.
- [rogue-net](https://github.com/entity-neural-network/rogue-net): Ragged batch transformer implementation that accepts variable length lists of structured objects as inputs.
- [enn-zoo](https://github.com/entity-neural-network/enn-zoo): Collection of entity gym bindings for different environments.
