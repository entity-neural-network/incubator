## Dev Setup

```bash
pip -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install -e entity_gym
pip install -e enn_ppo  # If you didn't have torch installed already, the torch-scatter install will fail. Just run the install command again.
```

### Rust

ENN uses optimized libraries, (such as ragged-buffer) written using rust. 
To use this library you will need to [install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install): 

## Code Formatting

We use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for code formatting.
You can run `black .` to format all files.
Make sure that your version of `black` matches the version in [`requirements-dev.txt`]().

## Running MyPy and Tests

```bash
dmypy run -- entity_gym enn_ppo
pytest .
```
