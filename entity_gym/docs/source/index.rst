Welcome to Entity Gym's documentation!
======================================

**Entity Gym** is an open source Python library that defines an entity based API for reinforcement learning environments.
Entity Gym extends the standard paradigm of fixed-size observation spaces by allowing observations to contain dynamically-sized lists of entities.
This enables a seamless and highly efficient interface with simulators, games, and other complex environments whose state can be naturally expressed as a collection of entities.
